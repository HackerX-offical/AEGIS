# Contributing to HackerX Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **HX Security Intelligence CLI**. We adhere to strict engineering standards.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful.
- Be educational.
- No "black hat" tools or features allowed.

## Development Standards

1.  **TypeScript Strictly**: No `any` types unless absolutely unavoidable (and documented).
2.  **Defensive Coding**: Validate all inputs. Handle all errors.
3.  **Comments**: Code must be self-documenting, but complex algorithms (like entropy) require inline explainer comments.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch (`feat/new-engine`).
3.  Ensure `npm run build` passes.
4.  Submit PR with a detailed description of the security concept being taught.
